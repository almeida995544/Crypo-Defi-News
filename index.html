            <font size="+3">As of May 30, 2022, Tron has managed to
become the third largest defi blockchain in terms of total locked
value. At the time of writing, Tron's TVL in defi is $5.94 billion,
which is just below the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) TVL and above
Avalanche's (AVAX) TVL.<br>
Amid the fallout from Terra LUNA and UST, on May 12, 2022, Tron's TVL
was $3.97 billion and the blockchain was ranked number five in terms of
TVL size by chains. That day, Tron's TVL was down 16.16% from what it
was on May 5, but after the Terra fiasco subsided, Tron took the third
position in terms of TVL in defi.<br>

            <font size="+3">YOP Finance, the DeFi interface that allows
users to earn passive income on their crypto assets, is now available
to all users. After a highly successful private launch, this will be
the first time that all users will be able to use the platform. Users
can leverage YOP vaults and earn passive income on their
cryptocurrencies with APYs of up to 65%. The platform is designed to be
intuitive and extremely easy to use, removing any barriers to entry for
the average investor to earn passive income that was previously only
available to a select few.<br>
Since its public launch, the platform has already reached over $1
million in TVL, with $600,000 being locked in within the first 72
hours. YOP Vaults will initially have increased limits to allow a large
number of users to invest and earn passive income in their digital
assets.</font><br>

Optimism is a rollup: a layer 2 scaling solution that bundles
transactions on another blockchain and sends them back to Ethereum as a
single transaction. Rollups enjoy the security of the Ethereum mainnet
while lowering transaction fees.<br>
The L2 network did not say how much cheaper Bedrock would transact or
when it would launch. Simple transfers on Optimism currently cost
around $0.28. Optimism said that the new update also improves the sync

            <a href="https://thedefiant.io/bear-market-2022-vs-2018/" target="_blank">Is it different this time? Analysts Explain This Year's Cryptocurrency Crash</a><br>
            <font size="-2">20-5-22<br>
            <font size="+3">The most popular tokens of 2021 – Layer 1s,
GameFi, meme tokens and DeFi 2.0 – are down more than 75% from their
all-time highs. As the market prepares for a crypto winter, one
question swirls in traders' minds: how low can it go?<br>
Those who endured the harsh crypto winter of late 2018 and early 2019
might remember that BTC is down 83% after its 2017 high of $19,665, and
ETH is down 94% to $83 about 11 months after its former high. peak of
$1,448.<br>
At press time, about six months after the all-time highs of BTC and
ETH, the two biggest cryptocurrencies are down 56% and 59%,
respectively. If this cycle were to copy the last one, BTC would drop
from $68,789 to $12,000 and ETH would drop from $4,878 to under $300.<br>
Of course, no two cycles are the same. “This is uncharted territory.
Since cryptocurrency’s inception, we’ve been on a decade-long bull run
with low-to-zero interest rates,” DeFi analyst The DeFi Edge told The
Defiant. “We are facing 40-year high inflation rates. Cryptocurrency
needs more money to grow and it’s a horrible environment right now.<br>

            <a href="https://bitcoinleef.com/santiments-metric-shows-ethereum-approaching-the-opportunity-zone/">Santiment’s Metric Shows Ethereum Approaching “Opportunity” Zone</a><br>
            <font size="-2">17-5-22<br>
            <font size="+3">If Ethereum is hitting an “opportunity zone”, as Santiment claims, then the price is likely to start to resurface.<br>
“ETH’s MVRV 90D, which measures the medium-term profit/loss of holders,
is revealing that we are close to entering the opportunity zone, which
has historically witnessed a local fund being established with solid
R/R,” according to Santiment Insights, an on-chain analytics platform.<br>
Santiment's MVRV measures the emotional state of an asset at a given
time and uses probability to calculate the probability of future price
movement. MVRV, or Market Value to Realized Value, is a relationship
that tells you whether an item's price is reasonable or excessively
high. MVRV can be used to estimate market peaks and valleys on its own.<br>
According to Santiment, despite market conditions, Ethereum had one of
its highest weekly trading volumes, with the company noting that “this
week had the highest ETH trading volume (even more than the previous
collapse in January 2022) and looks like it's some decent rendition
volume."<br>

            <font size="-2">18-5-22<br>
            <font size="+3">Logarithmic Finance (LOG) is a Defi token
or currency and platform that offers a variety of crucial features that
set it apart from other tokens like PancakeSwap (CAKE) and THORchain
(RUNE). The Defi token has a platform known as the “next-generation
layer III exchange protocol carefully designed and built to promote
seamless connectivity between innovators and early stage investors”.<br>
Comparing the platform and token with Defi tokens like PancakeSwap
(CAKE) and Thorchain (RUNE) gives you the freedom to boost your project
and attract investors who will grow your project and make the most of
the power of decentralized finance.<br>

            <font size="-2">18-5-22<br>
            <font size="+3">Decred’s native token, DCR, surged from its
April 12 low of $52.4 to an intraday high of $86.1 in April up 18%, a
jump of more than 64% in less than seven days. . Furthermore, the
nearly 44% jump from April 12th pushed DCR prices above the seven-month
downtrend line resistance.<br>
Furthermore, the token’s bullish move is likely to trigger a technical
pattern that could help the DCR continue its uptrend. The 20-day
exponential moving average of the Decred token (red wave) is likely to
move above the 50-day EMA (yellow wave), forming a golden cross.<br>
Traders and analysts often interpret the pattern as an indicator of a definite uptrend in the market.</font><br>

      <font size="-2">14-3-22<br>
      <font size="+3">Social engineering attacks often involve some
form of psychological manipulation, tricking unsuspecting users or
employees into handing over sensitive or confidential data. Commonly,
social engineering involves email or other communication that invokes
urgency, fear, or similar emotions in the victim, prompting the victim
to immediately reveal confidential information, click on a malicious
link, or open a malicious file. Because social engineering involves a
human element, preventing these attacks can be tricky for companies.<br>

      <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-crypto-hackers-always-end-up-getting-caught-out" target="_blank">Why Crypto Hackers Always Get Caught</a><br>
      <font size="-2">15-3-22<br>
      <font size="+3">Since the early days of cryptocurrency, hackers
have been one of the biggest threats to the space. As markets have
grown, the security of cryptocurrencies has become one of the most
significant sources of discomfort for investors. After several
high-profile heists on exchanges like Bitfinex and Mt.Gox, the popular
wisdom in the crypto space was that you should store funds in a
non-custodial wallet. But even they are not necessarily safe. If white
hat hackers can penetrate a hardware wallet to restore lost encryption,
you can bet a black hat hacker would be ready to exploit the same
weaknesses.<br>
In some cases, funds are quickly restored, such as the recent Wormhole
Bridge attack. Project operators were quick to discover that a generous
bounty for bugs often proves more attractive than keeping illicit
funds, which is the ideal outcome from a user's point of view. However,
if the authorities get involved, theft victims can wait months or even
years to restore their stolen cryptocurrencies. After the DoJ recently
arrested two people in connection with the laundering of stolen
Bitfinex funds, it appears that those affected may face a legal dispute
to recoup their losses.<br>

      <font size="-2">21-5-22<br>
      <font size="+3">Staking is tricky, but learning the truth behind these four myths will help increase the mass adoption of liquid staking.<br>
Blockchains rely on proof-of-work (PoW) validation from the very
beginning. However, the PoW consensus proved to be unsustainable with
its high power usage and its need for fast and powerful hardware
creating huge barriers to entry. That's why blockchains are adopting
proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus algorithms, where those who want to earn
rewards don't have to compete against other miners, but can simply
stake part of their cryptocurrency for a chance to be chosen to be one.

      <font size="-2">21-5-22<br>
      <font size="+3">While DATA cannot accurately replace traditional VCs, it can potentially disrupt the cryptocurrency industry.<br>
What is a DAO?<br>
A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is an online
organization that exists and operates without a single leader or
governing body. DAOs are run by code written on a blockchain like
Ethereum (ETH) and are owned and operated by the people who use them.<br>
There are many different types of DAOs, but they all have one thing in
common: they are decentralized, which means that decisions about the
organization's future are decided by the collective group rather than a
single individual.<br>
This decentralization is what makes DAOs promising, as it theoretically
eliminates the possibility of corruption or manipulation by a single
entity. Smart contracts (not people) enforce the organization's terms
and conditions, making them incredibly efficient and resilient to
change.<br>
